## ‚ö†Ô∏è Registration

We are happy if you want to join this instance.

But at the moment we are *almost* full, so unfortunately we can't accept every request. 
*Please tell us why you want to join this instance* - and what type of cyberpunk you are!

If your request was declined, please do not take it personally. 
This has nothing to do with you or your request - we currently have to manage capacities.

Once you have been accepted, you have 24 hours to claim your account. If there is no activity after 24 hours, the account will be automatically closed to give others a chance. See also our [terms](https://corteximplant.com/terms) and our rules (see article below).

What do we mean by claim:

- Create profile
- Introduce yourself
- Share content
- Communicate

Many thanks for your understanding!
