### Liability for content

As a provider, we are responsible for our own content on this Mastodon instance (https://corteximplant.com) and our Pixelfed instance (https://cyberpunk.pics) in accordance with general laws pursuant to § 7 Para. 1 TMG.

### Data protection notice

This privacy policy explains what information is processed when you use the Mastodon instance (https://corteximplant.com) and Pixelfed instance (https://cyberpunk.pics) and what rights you have against us, the operator of the instances. All explanations presented here and the clarification of your rights are based on the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in force since 25.05.2018.

1. Data processing when calling up the start page, registration mask and use in general.

As soon as you call up the start page of CORTEX IMPLANT (https://corteximplant.com) and CYBERPUNK.PICS (https://cyberpunk.pics) in order to register or also during use in general, a connection is established to the web server on which this instance is operated. In order to be able to display the page to the browser of your terminal device, certain data is processed in the process in accordance with the HTTP and TCP/IP protocols. This includes:

- the IP address of your Internet connection
- the operating system version of your PC, tablet or smartphone,
- the display resolution of your device,
- the location of your device,
- the Internet browser you are using, and
- the time of your access to the website.

This technical data is processed so that this website can be transmitted from the web server to your terminal device and can be processed and displayed correctly by your browser. After each page visit, some of this data is stored in logs of the web hoster. My web hoster processes this data for server maintenance and security purposes, but deletes IP addresses after 14 days at the latest, usually sooner. The server of this instance is operated by a professional hoster with servers in the European Union. He is subject to my instructions as a processor and has contractually agreed to comply with technical and organizational security measures.

GDPR order processing contract concluded with: 

DigitalOcean EU B.V. - Zweigniederlassung Deutschland  
Am Sandtorkai 68  
20457 Hamburg  
Deutschland  

DigitalOcean EU B.V.  
Zekeringstraat 17 A  
Amsterdam  
1014BM  
Netherlands  


In this context, data processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR to the extent necessary to enable you to call up the home page and register as part of the user relationship between us (the operators of the instance) and you (the operator of the Mastodon (https://corteximplant.com) and Pixelfed (https://cyberpunk.pics) account), as well as to fulfill the obligation to take technical and organizational protective measures.

2. Data processing during registration

During registration, we process basic account information: This includes username, email address and password. You may also enter additional profile information, such as a display name or biography, and upload a profile picture or header image. The username, display name, biography, profile picture and header picture will then always be displayed publicly.

The data processing in the context of registration is thereby carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 letter b) GDPR to the extent necessary to enable you to call the registration in the context of the user relationship.

3. Data processing during the use of your Mastodon (https://corteximplant.com) or Pixelfed (https://cyberpunk.pics) account

- Posts, follow and other public information: The list of people you follow is shown publicly, the same applies to your following (followers). Once you submit a message, the date and time is saved along with the information about which application you used to do so. Messages may contain media attachments, such as images and videos. Public and unlisted posts are publicly available. Once you pin a post on your profile, it is also publicly available. Your posts are delivered to your following, which in some cases means they are delivered to other servers (other instances) and copies are stored there. Once you delete posts, this is likewise delivered to your followers. The actions of sharing and favoriting another post are always public.

- Direct and "Following Only" posts: All posts are stored and processed on the server. "Following only" posts are delivered to your followers and to users who mention you, direct posts ("direct messages") are delivered only to users mentioned in them. Direct messages, however, are not end-to-end encrypted and are therefore also viewable by us and, if applicable, the server operator of the recipient's instance. We can only ensure that unauthorized users cannot access the messages stored on our instance, but other servers/instances may fail to do so. That is why it is important to check the instance to which your following belong. You can also toggle an option in the settings to manually accept or reject new follows. Please note that the operators of the server and any receiving server might view such messages and recipients might make a screen copy of them, copy them or otherwise redistribute them. Therefore, do not share sensitive information on Mastodon (https://corteximplant.com) and Pixelfed (https://cyberpunk.pics).

- Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses) and other metadata: As soon as you log in, our Mastodon instance (https://corteximplant.com) and Pixelfed instance (https://cyberpunk.pics) collects both the IP address from which you log in and the name of your browser application. All logged in sessions (sessions) are available for your review and revocation in the settings. Mastodon (https://corteximplant.com) and Pixelfed (https://cyberpunk.pics) stores the last IP address used for up to 12 months.

The data processing in the context of use is thereby carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 letter b) GDPR to the extent necessary to enable you to use your Mastodon (https://corteximplant.com) and Pixelfed (https://cyberpunk.pics)  account in the context of the usage relationship.

4. Use of cookies

Our Mastodon instance (https://corteximplant.com) and Pixelfed instance (https://cyberpunk.pics) uses cookies (small text files that make your browser uniquely distinguishable from others) to provide you with core and convenience features. Among other things, these cookies allow the instance to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, to link it to your registered account.

5. Data processing during e-mail communication

If you contact the administration by e-mail, your e-mail including sender address and content will be processed and stored in order to handle the communication with you. This information will be stored for as long as is necessary to address the content of your request. Unless required by the specific nature of our communications, old emails are generally deleted one year after we receive the last response from you and contact information is deleted after two years.

The storage and use of the data contained in the e-mails as well as your contact data is carried out to the extent necessary due to my legitimate interest in handling communication with you, insofar as your interests do not conflict with this (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR).

6. Your rights

You have the right to request,

- That we provide information about the personal data concerning you and processed by us here (Art. 15 GDPR).
- That we correct incorrect data (Art. 16 GDPR).
- that your data will be deleted if, for example, it is no longer necessary for the original purpose or if there is a dispute as to whether we are processing certain data lawfully (Art. 17 GDPR).
- the restriction of processing if the conditions of Art. 18 GDPR are met.
- to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format (Art. 20 GDPR).
- In particular, you may object at any time, on grounds relating to a particular situation, to processing carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR (Art. 21 GDPR).

With regard to all the aforementioned rights, the following applies: a corresponding request sent to me by e-mail or in writing by mail (address in the imprint) is sufficient to exercise your rights.
